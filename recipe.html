veg momos recipe | momos ki recipe | momos banane ki recipe with step by step photo and video recipe. india has generously embraced many of is neighbouring countries recipes in its cuisine. especially in urban location, these alien recipes has been accepted as popular evening street food snacks. one such hugely popular street food snack is momos recipe which can be done with myriad and countless stuffing.

momos recipe is very common in my house and i keep preparing it with a wide variety of stuffings. as a matter of fact, i end up making these cute looking dumpling with any leftover dry sabziâ€™s. in addition, to make my life easier i do get a square-shaped momos sheet here in asian supermarkets under the fridge section. so basically my job is to stuff the veggies and shape it as required and steam it till it gets cooked. but in this recipe, i have showcased both stuffing and momos sheet from scratch. momos sheet can be overwhelming for a novice chef and hence you can opt for frozen momos sheets. but the stuffing is extremely simple and can be made in minutes.
