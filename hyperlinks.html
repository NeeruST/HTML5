        Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

        Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an argument and a working thesis statement for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea. In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.

        Internal linking is something you’ll find that most SEO experts recommend.

By creating an easy-to-follow structure of links, you’ll achieve the following:

1. Improved crawlability of your site
In order for your web pages to rank in search, search engines need to be able to find your pages.

Both the quantity and context of internal links can tell search engines a lot about your website, including which pages are the most important to index. So, your strategy should reflect this.

2. Enhanced user experience
Internal links enable you to be proactive and helpful, providing information at the right time and the most convenient spot for your visitors.

For instance: The things you write about on your blog may relate to the services advertised elsewhere. So it may be a good idea to link the services from the blog.

If visitors have a positive experience moving around your site, they’re going to visit more pages.

3. Increased page authority and ranking
Internal links pass link equity. This means, that by linking to a page within your site, you may improve the rankings of the page and tell the search engine other important information, such as:

How do different parts of your site (and business) connect to this one?
What kinds of topics are related to the one covered on this page?
Which pages are the most important based on how frequently they’re linked to?
It works the other way round too. Your highest priority pages (like Home, Services, or Shop) hold a lot of value for you and your visitors, which increases the authority of these pages. When you link to other pages from these valuable pages, that authority gets passed onto the linked pages.
